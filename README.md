# RSA-EIGamal

This project aims to running RSA and EIGamal.
This project used Junit as unit test. There are three class to test different parts of project.
  1.AlgorithmsLibTest : test the basic algorithms used in RSA or EIGamal
  2.EIGamalTest: test the encrypt, decrypt, and eaves drop & decrypt Cipher text. 
                 However, due to java long size limitation. baby step giant step doesn't work when braking the cipher text.
  3.RSATest: test the encrypt, decrypt, and eaves drop & decrypt Cipher text.

User manual :
Run the main method.
  It will show "1.EIGamal 2.RSA 3.STOP" and ask for a intput (1) (2)or (3) to excute different parts.
